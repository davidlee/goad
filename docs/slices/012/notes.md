# Notes — Slice 012

Durable per-slice scratchpad and the only record of progress. Phase sheets are
expanded here just before execution and left in place; anything worth keeping
after the slice closes is lifted into the Harvest section.

## Status

| phase | state | as of |
|-------|-------|-------|
| PHASE-01 | pending / in progress / done / blocked | |

## Phase sheets

<!-- One block per phase, written at phase-plan time, immediately before
     execution. Disposable detail — it exists to get one agent through one
     phase. -->

### PHASE-01 — <name>

**Objective:** <copied from plan.md>

**Reading list**
<!-- path:line references, the design sections that bind, prior art. -->

**Assumptions & STOP conditions**
<!-- What is being taken on faith, and the specific conditions under which the
     agent must stop and consult the user rather than improvise. -->

**Tasks**
<!-- [ ] todo · [~] in progress · [x] done · [!] blocked -->
- [ ]

**Decisions taken during execution**
<!-- Small and local: how, within what the design already settled. A choice that
     changes the design is not one of these — stop, consult the user, and record
     it in `design-log.md`. -->

**Findings**
<!-- Things noticed in passing that are not this phase's job: a defect
     elsewhere, drift from the design, a surprise. Defects in this phase's own
     work get fixed, not recorded. These feed the audit; the ones that outlive
     the slice become Follow-ups. -->

## Harvest

<!-- Updated in place, not appended. Ids and one-line hooks only — never
     restate content that lives elsewhere. -->

**Fresh as of:** <yyyy-mm-dd> · <phase or stage> · <commit>

### Produced
<!-- What now exists: modules, contracts, docs. -->

### Learned
<!-- Durable facts a future agent would otherwise rediscover. Candidates for
     `docs/memory/`. -->

### Open
<!-- Still unresolved at this point. Candidates for follow-ups. -->

- **Brief §21 AC-14 has no home.** The interstitial-journal scenario (brief §18)
  is to be replaced by a better one the user has in mind; neither 012 nor a
  slice of its own discharges the journal as written (`design-log.md`,
  2026-09-26, OQ-1). The roadmap's coverage row 14 still says *"012, or its own
  slice"*. Candidate follow-up at close.

- **`claude plugin eval` and `claude plugin details` exist** (Claude Code
  2.1.280). `eval` runs eval cases against a plugin with a no-plugin baseline
  arm, and `details` reports a plugin's projected token cost. Both bear on
  AC-1/AC-8's walk method, which was decided before they were known
  (`research.md` R-d). For design: adopt, or say why not.
- **SPEC-004 OQ-2** — `goad-emit`'s statuses are owned but not governed. The
  checker entering §4 makes that asymmetry sharper (`research.md`
  *Cross-thread* 4).
- **`claude plugin eval` as a regression harness for kit edits.** Not adopted
  for AC-1 (`design-log.md`, 2026-09-27, OQ-7). Candidate follow-up at close.
- **`Shape` refusals cite R-44 only.** Naming the requirement the backend
  misread needs normalization to report a path for serde failures
  (`design-log.md`, 2026-09-26, OQ-8). Candidate follow-up at close.
- **R-16 has no non-empty clause for a `choice` field's `options`.**
  `EmptyAlternatives` cites R-52, as SPEC-001 §7 and the corpus do. A canon
  wording fix, not a behaviour change (design.md §6 OQ-6). Candidate follow-up.
- **The jail library fixes the home per profile.** 012 binds a launcher-made
  home over `$HOME` locally; a home-name parameter upstream in
  `davidlee/nix-config` is cleaner (design.md §6 OQ-7). Candidate follow-up.
