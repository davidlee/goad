# Notes — Slice 012

Durable per-slice scratchpad and the only record of progress. Phase sheets are
expanded here just before execution and left in place; anything worth keeping
after the slice closes is lifted into the Harvest section.

## Phase sheets

<!-- One block per phase, written at phase-plan time, immediately before
     execution. Disposable detail — it exists to get one agent through one
     phase. -->

### PHASE-01 — <name>

**Objective:** <copied from plan.md>

**Reading list**
<!-- path:line references, the design sections that bind, prior art. -->

**Assumptions & STOP conditions**
<!-- What is being taken on faith, and the specific conditions under which the
     agent must stop and consult the user rather than improvise. -->

**Tasks**
<!-- [ ] todo · [~] in progress · [x] done · [!] blocked -->
- [ ]

**Decisions taken during execution**
<!-- Small and local: how, within what the design already settled. A choice that
     changes the design is not one of these — stop, consult the user, and record
     it in `design-log.md`. -->

**Findings**
<!-- Things noticed in passing that are not this phase's job: a defect
     elsewhere, drift from the design, a surprise. Defects in this phase's own
     work get fixed, not recorded. These feed the audit; the ones that outlive
     the slice become Follow-ups. -->

## Harvest

<!-- Updated in place, not appended. Ids and one-line hooks only — never
     restate content that lives elsewhere. -->

**Fresh as of:** <yyyy-mm-dd> · <phase or stage> · <commit>

### Produced
<!-- What now exists: modules, contracts, docs. -->

### Learned
<!-- Durable facts a future agent would otherwise rediscover. Candidates for
     `docs/memory/`. -->

### Open
<!-- Still unresolved at this point. Candidates for follow-ups. -->

- **Brief §21 AC-14 has no home.** The interstitial-journal scenario (brief §18)
  is to be replaced by a better one the user has in mind; neither 012 nor a
  slice of its own discharges the journal as written (`design-log.md`,
  2026-09-26, OQ-1). The roadmap's coverage row 14 still says *"012, or its own
  slice"*. Candidate follow-up at close.

- **`claude plugin eval` and `claude plugin details` exist** (Claude Code
  2.1.280). `eval` runs eval cases against a plugin with a no-plugin baseline
  arm, and `details` reports a plugin's projected token cost. Both bear on
  AC-1/AC-8's walk method, which was decided before they were known
  (`research.md` R-d). For design: adopt, or say why not.
- **SPEC-004 OQ-2** — `goad-emit`'s statuses are owned but not governed. The
  checker entering §4 makes that asymmetry sharper (`research.md`
  *Cross-thread* 4).
- **`claude plugin eval` as a regression harness for kit edits.** Not adopted
  for AC-1 (`design-log.md`, 2026-09-27, OQ-7). Candidate follow-up at close.
- **`goad`'s own reporters do not carry R-59's side and requirement.** R-59 was
  narrowed to what a refusal names; the diagnostics surface (SPEC-003/R-15)
  and `goad`'s stderr are not bound to show both (`design-log.md`, 2026-09-30).
  Rendering work once R-59 lands. Candidate follow-up at close.
- **`Shape` refusals cite R-44 only.** Naming the requirement the backend
  misread needs normalization to report a path for serde failures
  (`design-log.md`, 2026-09-26, OQ-8). Candidate follow-up at close.
- ~~**R-16 has no non-empty clause for a `choice` field's `options`.**~~
  **Closed in this slice** (`design-log.md` 2026-09-30, *design review round
  2: dispositions*; review F-38): `canon-delta.md` SPEC-001 Change 6 adds "at
  least one" to R-16, and `EmptyAlternatives` cites R-16.
- **The jail library fixes the home per profile.** A home-name parameter
  upstream in `davidlee/nix-config` is cleaner than a local bind (design.md
  §6 OQ-7). The walk no longer needs either: it runs in an oubliette capsule
  (2026-09-30). Candidate follow-up only if a jail is used again.
- **An untouched `number` field can submit a value outside its own range.**
  `view_model::as_drawn` answers min-or-zero, so `max: -10` with no `min`
  submits `0`. Existing host behaviour; the checker mirrors it (design.md §5.5
  edges). Candidate follow-up against the renderer.
- **`goad-check --now`.** Not built: a time-gated backend is checked at an
  hour it speaks, and the report says when no view was returned
  (`design-log.md` 2026-09-30, U3; review F-7). Build it only if walk friction
  names it; it strains SPEC-001/R-7's "current instant" and reaches only
  backends that read `now`. Candidate follow-up.
- **A variant-enumerating derive for the reference coverage test.** The
  coverage test's instances are hand-kept, so a new variant compiles once its
  arm exists, with or without an instance: compile gate plus review, as
  SPEC-003 §7's R-14 row states for the same pattern (design.md §5.2.6;
  review F-22). A derive such as `strum`'s would make it an assertion; the
  user declined it for now (`design-log.md` 2026-09-30, *R-59 reframed;
  PipeMissing; F-22; round 2's unbriefed repairs*). Candidate follow-up, with
  SPEC-003's R-14 case as a second user.
- **FU-7's citation extends to `goad-check`.** Nothing bills a stratum-3
  manifest, so `goad-check` linking no renderer is held by its manifest
  comment and review (design.md §5.5 I-6; review F-26). Extend FU-7 at close.
- **FU-5's citation extends to the kit fence scanner.** `goad-check`'s tests
  carry a second fence scanner beside `goad-shell`'s `round_trip.rs`
  `fenced_block`, because test targets share no helpers across crates
  (design.md §5.2.6). Extend FU-5 at close.
