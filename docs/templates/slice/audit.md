# Audit & reconciliation — Slice NNN

Written after the last phase is done. Two jobs in one document:

1. **Audit** — does the work match its design, its acceptance criteria, and
   canon? Every gap dispositioned, none left implicit.
2. **Reconcile** — make the record true again. The code is what shipped; the
   specs must say so, or the code must change.

## Brief

**Subject:** <commit range / branch under audit>
**Question:** <what would have to be true for this slice to be finished, and
which of those the audit intends to actually check. Write it before looking, so
the audit is not shaped by what turned out to be easy to find.>

<!-- This is the audit's scope — evidence, criteria, canon. The code review's
     own lines of attack belong in `review-code.md`'s Brief, not here. -->

## Evidence

<!-- What was run and what it said. Not a claim of correctness — the basis for
     one. -->

- **Tests / checks:** <commands run, results>
- **Acceptance criteria:** each AC in `slice-nnn.md`, met / not met, with the
  evidence.
- **Verification criteria:** each VT/VA/VH in `plan.md`, discharged or not.
- **Surface delta:** paths actually changed vs. the surfaces each phase
  declared. Undeclared paths are the highest-signal lead — scope creep, a
  missed design update, or an undocumented touch. Declared-but-untouched means
  dropped work or a stale design. Neither is automatically a finding; both are
  places to look.

## Code review

Findings live in `review-code.md`, copied from
`docs/templates/review-ledger.md` — same ledger, same severity and disposition
vocabulary, subject `implementation`. Do not restate findings here.

- **Ledger:** `review-code.md`
- **State:** open | resolved · outstanding blockers: none | <ids>

## Verdict

<!-- The slice's closure story, written once, here. Draws on the ledger's
     synthesis and on the evidence above; restates neither. Does this slice do
     what it set out to do, and what is being accepted knowingly? -->

## Reconciliation

<!-- Making the record true. One row per document that must change, and the
     change itself. Amending canon requires explicit user endorsement — ask
     before writing, not after. -->

| document | change | reason | done |
|----------|--------|--------|------|
| `specs/NNN-…md §4` | | code diverged at `path:line`; code is right | [ ] |
| `draft-spec.md` → `specs/NNN-slug.md` | promote | drafted during this slice | [ ] |

**Design drift not reconciled:** <where the implementation departs from
`design.md` and the design was left as-is, with the reason. The design is a
record of intent at a point in time; it is not retro-fitted to the code
without saying so.>

## Closure

- [ ] All findings dispositioned; no blockers outstanding
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met, or explicitly waived by the user
- [ ] Tests and checks green
- [ ] Specs / policy / ADRs reconciled, with user endorsement where amended
- [ ] `draft-spec.md` / `canon-delta.md` promoted, or abandoned with the reason written down
- [ ] `slice-nnn.md` Summary and Follow-ups written
- [ ] `notes.md` Harvest current; durable facts lifted to `docs/memory/`
- [ ] `slice-nnn.md` stage set to `done`
